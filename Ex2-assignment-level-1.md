## writeCode

Define 5 values of number and string data types and store them in a variable.


## writeCode

- Declare a variable `user` and take the name using `prompt`. Display the value stored in `user` using `alert`.
- Now re-assign the value stored in the above example into a new variable `userName`. Log the value of both `user` and `userName` in console using `console.log`.
- Declare `age` and `gender` in the same line as `userName` i.e. declare multiple variables in one line.
- Now change the value of `user` to "John" and log the value of both `user` and `userName`.

## writeCode

Use `prompt` to take two numbers from user and store them in variables `numA` and `numB`. Create a third variable called `sum`, using `+` operator add numA and numB , store the result in varible `sum` and using alert display `sum` in browser.
