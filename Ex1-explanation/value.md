## What is Value-readText

The most fundamental unit of information in programming is called value or data. It can be any piece of information like your name or age.

For example

`name` can be `"Arya"` or `age` can be `23`.

`"Arya"` and `23` in programming terms are called values.

You can have different kind of values: a letter, word, paragraph, number etc. These values are divided into different types also know as `Data Types` or you can call it `Value Types`. All the values have to be one of the following types.

### Data Types

1. Number (`21`, `21.45` )
2. String (`"a"`, `"hello"`, `"A quick brown fox jumped over lazy dog!"`)
3. Boolean (`true`, `false`)
4. `null`
5. `undefined`
6. Object

Latest addition to JavaScript family:

7. **Symbol**
8. **BigInt**

#### Number

All numeric values are of `number` data type in JavaScript. Example of number type would be

```js
133,
  1,
  456 - 123, // Integers
  -324; // Negative Numbers
132.43, -12.23; // Decimal point number
Infinity, NaN, -Infinity; // Special numbers
```

**JavaScript uses a fixed number of bits i.e `64` to store a single number.**

Special numbers are values that are of number data type but doesn't exactly behaves like numbers in some cases.

```js
Infinity - 1; // Infinity
```

Numbers can be manipulated using arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication etc. To do that we use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`).

```js
24 + 21; // 45
45 - 20; // 25
30 * 20; // 600
20 + 10 * 11; // 130
```

Symbols like (`+`, `-`, `*`) used above are called Operators. Putting the operator between two values will return a new value. Like in above example using the `+` operator on numbers 24 and 21 returns 45.

#### BigInt

Used to represent any number bigger than 9007199254740991 or smaller than -9007199254740991. For BigInt you need to add `n` at the end of the value.

```js
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

---

#### String

Any representation of text is `string` data type in JavaScript.

Example:

```js
"a"; // letter
"A"; // uppercase letter
"Hello"; // word
"Hello World!"; // single quote
"JavaScript is a single threaded language!"; // paragraph
```

**Visual Impression to identify string:** Anything wrapped in `''` , `""` or `backticks` is a string.

---

#### Boolean

To differentiate between only two possible values like `day` or `night` , `yes` or `no` , `on` or `off` we use boolean data type in JavaScript that has only two fixed values: `true` or `false`.

- `true` can represent values like `on` or `yes`

- `false` represents values like `off` or `no`

---

#### Void Values (Empty)

To represent the existence of no meaningful values we use special values i.e `null` or `undefined`. These are values that carry no information. It is used for the places where the operation doesn't produce meaningful value.

`undefined` is the only value of type undefined. `null` is the only value of type null.

There is no fundamental difference between `null` or `undefined`. In most of the case you can treat them as interchangeable.

---

#### Object

Object is a collection of `key` and `value` pairs seperated by comma `,`. Where key is a `string`, while `value` can be any data type like number, boolean, string, null, undefined, symbol or object.

```js
var user = {
  name: "Arya",
  age: 21,
  house: "Stark",
  isAdult: true
};
```
Above, the `user` obect has 4 `key` & `value` pairs, with `name`, `age`, `house` and `isAdult` being the `keys` and the data after `:` being `values`, i.e. `"Arya"`, `21`, `"Stark"`

### `typeof`

To check the data type of any value we use `typeof` operator. It always returns `string` data types with value specifying the data type that was checked by `typeof`.

```js
typeof 21; // "number"
typeof "Hello"; // "string"
typeof true; // "boolean"
typeof undefined; // "undefined"
typeof null; // "object" ðŸ”¥Boop
```

`typeof null` returns `"object"` is a bug in JavaScript. It can't be fixed ever because there are lots of website depends on this error.

## Category of value types-readText

All the data types explained above can be categorised in two different types.

#### 1. Primitive Data Type:

Primitive data type are basic type provided by programming language as a building block of values like number, text etc. **Primitive Data Types are immutable (can't be changed) in nature.**

- Primitive Data Types
  - number
  - string
  - boolean
  - null
  - undefined
  - null
  - symbol
  - BigInt

#### 2. Object (Non-Primitive) Data Type:

For storing some complicated data, programmig languages provide some ways to handle it, starting from primitive type. They have built-in support (adding, removing, changing) for these kind of data types. Everything that is not primitive is an object in JavaScript. example: function, array etc.

//FEEDBACK: this section is very hard to understand.

**Non-Primitive Data Types are mutable (can be changed).**

- Object Type (Non-primitive Data Type)
